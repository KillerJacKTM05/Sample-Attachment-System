-This repository has an alternative movement system for original puppetmaster scripts, has fly and kick features. This attachment manager
script allows player to attach bomb or balloon to the target character with using your fingers, simple drag-drop mechanism.
-Character stands on a platform and platform rotates around itself. This allow player to see all parts of the character and attach objects
to him.
-Piano Script simply follows the character around a straight line and will be triggered when the character enters to the trigger. Piano
falls to the ground and simply breaks down.
-Toucher uses LeanTouch addon for using mouse instead of real fingers and determines the movement.
-Fracture gives fracture effect to the kickable objects whom determined via unique layer.
-Balloon uses blend shape for inflation.
